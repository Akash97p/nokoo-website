# Feature backlog

This backlog turns the long-term product direction into independently testable branches. Ordering may change when a prerequisite or security concern is discovered, but each completed task must update this file.

## Foundation tasks

### F01 — Native Settings window

- Status: initial implementation complete; provider, route, and richer sound sections expand with their foundations.
- Add a tray action and single-instance WPF Settings window.
- Provide validated sections for general behavior, toast placement/lifetime, history, startup, sounds, custom types, channels, routes, and diagnostics.
- Save atomically and make restart requirements explicit.

### F02 — Extensible notification definitions

- Status: implemented and runtime-smoked; human Settings visual inspection pending.
- Preserve compatibility with the eight built-in API values.
- Add user-defined types with stable IDs, display names, colors/icons, default priority, sticky/expiry behavior, and enabled state.
- Define safe fallback behavior when a custom type is deleted or disabled.

### F03 — Sound profiles

- Status: implemented and covered by file/config tests; human playback/UI verification pending.
- Support global and per-type sound choices, mute, volume, and preview.
- Accept common formats supported reliably on Windows, beginning with WAV and MP3.
- Copy approved files into a managed per-user directory; validate size/type and handle missing files safely.
- Add quiet-hours and critical-notification override policy hooks.

### F04 — Delivery persistence and encrypted secrets

- Status: implemented with transactional schema v1, atomic outbox claiming, DPAPI current-user envelopes, bounded inputs, redacted summaries, and durable/concurrency repository tests.
- Add versioned SQLite migrations for provider profiles, encrypted secret values, routing rules, outbox messages, and delivery attempts.
- Add a DPAPI current-user secret protector with versioned ciphertext envelopes and test-only portable implementation.
- Ensure all DTOs, diagnostics, exports, and logs redact credentials.

### F05 — Routing and durable delivery engine

- Status: core engine implemented; advanced time/attention-state matching remains grouped with F07.
- Match on type, priority, project, agent, time, and attention state.
- Persist work before dispatch; use bounded exponential retry with jitter, timeout, idempotency, and dead-letter state.
- Never block local persistence, the API response, or the WPF dispatcher on network delivery.
- Add per-route payload redaction and test-send.

### F06 — Channel management UI

- Status: initial webhook provider, route, test-send, deletion, and redacted diagnostics UI implemented; extend per adapter.
- Create, edit, enable, disable, test, and delete provider profiles.
- Show health, last success/failure, retry state, and actionable validation errors without revealing secrets.
- Require explicit consent before sending notification bodies off-device.

### F07 — Rules, quiet hours, and escalation

- Add per-project/agent/type routes, quiet schedules, snooze, grouping, cooldowns, and escalation delays.
- Make local critical attention behavior explicit and testable.

## Agent communication tasks

### A01 — Acknowledgement callbacks

Allow an agent to provide a safe loopback callback or polling correlation ID and observe delivered, viewed, dismissed, resolved, or failed state.

- Keep transport delivery, human view, human response, and native-host acceptance as separate
  states.
- Prefer authenticated polling or a broker-owned adapter connection over arbitrary callback URLs.

### A02 — Structured response actions

Support buttons and bounded text choices that return a structured response to a waiting agent without executing arbitrary commands.

- Status: broker, WebUI answering, and Relay/mobile answer path shipped. Durable interaction model (SQLite, keyed idempotency,
  supersede, first-valid-response-wins, digest/nonce binding, TTL, waiters) with loopback
  API (`request/list/get/wait/respond/cancel/publish`) and `interactions` CLI lives in
  [INTERACTIONS.md](INTERACTIONS.md). Host answer return works for Codex/Claude ask mode,
  Hermes transport, and the OpenClaw watcher; Relay publish, background response polling, and the
  mobile answer UI form the shipped path in [RELAY_INTERACTIONS.md](RELAY_INTERACTIONS.md). Remaining: native WPF response
  controls, sealed mobile responses, host-acceptance receipts, and broader answer adapters.
- Extend versioned interaction persistence with host-acceptance outcomes.
- Implement first-valid-response-wins across local desktop and mobile surfaces.
- Permission allow-once/deny, single choice, and bounded text are implemented; add multiselect/form
  and wider grant scopes only when the native host exposes matching semantics.
- Bind every remote response to the installation, session/turn, native request, request digest,
  expiry, and one-time nonce. Reject replay, stale, changed, and wrong-session responses.

### A03 — Agent registry and heartbeat

Track live agent instances, projects, working directories, last activity, and waiting state so the center answers “which agents need me?” reliably.

### A04 — SDKs and protocols

- Status: protocol assembly and ARC 0.2 create/update/respond/resolve ingestion implemented;
  agent-host research is complete; auto-notify harnesses for all eleven hosts (OpenCode,
  Codex, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Muse, Kilo, OpenClaw, Hermes, Pi) implemented with
  `install-harness`, embedded payloads, JSON-preserving merges, and ask mode for Codex/Claude —
  real-host smoke pending; ACP bridge and language SDKs remain planned.
- Publish small PowerShell, shell, Python, JavaScript, and .NET clients without replacing the stable
  REST/CLI path.
- Implement an Agent Client Protocol client as the common managed-session bridge. Do not confuse it
  with the Agent Communication Protocol that moved into A2A.
- Add direct native adapters for existing sessions where hosts expose synchronous hooks, plugins,
  SDKs, gateways, or RPC. Notify-only harnesses cover eleven hosts; Codex/Claude ask mode,
  Hermes, and OpenClaw return human answers through their host surfaces. Other answer adapters
  remain planned (see [HARNESS.md](HARNESS.md)).
- Keep provider streams and ACP/A2A/AEP adapters behind the same validation and persistence
  boundary as direct ARC events.
- Treat A2A, both current Agent Event Protocol drafts, and MCP elicitation as optional projections
  after the interaction contract and response model stabilize.

## Provider router

### R01 — Local provider router

- Status: implemented behind `routerEnabled` (off by default) and covered by automated tests;
  no traffic to a real provider yet, and the Windows tray build has not been compiled with it.
- Loopback `/router/v1` endpoints for OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions, and Anthropic
  Messages, authenticated with a router-specific key and refused to browsers.
- Upstreams with sealed keys and validated destinations; aliases and ordered failover combos;
  translation through one intermediate model with same-wire passthrough.
- Proxy-observed SQLite ledger with per-attempt rows, kept separate from Usage and Live quota.
- See [ROUTER.md](ROUTER.md).

### R03 — Routed models in each agent's own picker

- Status: Codex and Claude Code connectors implemented and verified live on macOS with the real
  agents against a scripted upstream; web page not yet seen in a browser.
- Codex: generated `model_catalog_json`, provider block with an embedded key, reasoning effort,
  subagent and review models, and shell tool.
- Claude Code: `modelPicker` rows with `behavesAs`, and the built-in entries' model variables.
- A copy before every write, restore of any copy, and disconnect that restores the owner's values.
- Remaining: OpenCode, Kilo, Cursor, and Gemini CLI connectors; real context windows per model.

### R04 — One-step providers and subscriptions

- Status: implemented on `feature/router-easy-setup`; model fetching, the ChatGPT plan, and OpenCode
  Go verified against the real services on macOS through a scratch broker; the Muse Code plan is
  untested because Muse Code is not installed on the test Mac.
- Provider gallery, fetched model lists with tick boxes, reuse of OpenCode's keys, per-model wires for
  OpenCode Zen and Go, and the ChatGPT-plan and Muse Code subscription upstreams.
- Remaining: a Muse Code sign-in kept in the OS keychain; AgentNotify's own sign-in flow for a plan
  instead of reusing another tool's; non-streaming requests to the ChatGPT backend, which only
  streams.

### R02 — Policy routing and richer combos

- Score candidates on capability, health, quota, cost, and latency evidence (`policy/<id>`), with a
  bounded, redacted decision trace.
- Status: ordered, sticky-until-failure, and round-robin same-model switching, one-way native Claude
  fallback, family-level effort mapping with per-model overrides, and Codex-wire effort translation
  are implemented and merged. Compiled and test-gated on macOS (1262 tests) and installed on the
  owner's Mac; the Windows/WSL gates, a human browser pass, and a real provider request are still
  outstanding — see `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.
- Weighted round-robin, weighted random, least-used, and reset-window combo strategies.
- Pin a Codex account pool; add Gemini and Ollama-native wires.
- Price ledger rows and correlate them with log-derived Usage records without double counting.
- Raise router spend and quota thresholds as ARC attention requests.

### R05 — Adaptive routing (prompt-to-model selection)

Downshift easy prompts to a cheaper capable model before route resolution, and keep hard ones on the
user's chosen model. Chosen over renaming the existing feature: "smart routing" already names
same-model cross-provider failover (see `docs/ROUTER.md`), which routes around a broken or exhausted
target; adaptive routing instead chooses *which model* serves the request by its difficulty, and the
two compose (adaptive selection first, then smart-routing failover on the chosen model).

- Stage 1 — local heuristics, no new dependency: token/character size, absence of code blocks and
  tool/function-call structures, and short-message patterns select a cheap tier defined by the owner
  on the Routing page. Must never apply to structured agent traffic by default (tool calls, subagent
  and review models, `wire_api = "responses"` requests with tool definitions).
- Stage 2 — BYOK decision model behind the same stage-1 interface: a web-UI toggle and encrypted key
  field (existing provider-secret envelope path, like API accounts) for [Jev by TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai),
  an early-access, hosted, decision-only model that returns typed choices with calibrated
  probabilities in tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Opt-in per user; off (and stage-1 heuristics
  only) when no key is set.
- Jev receives the prompt text, which sends user prompt content to a third party — document this in
  ROUTER.md and SECURITY.md under the same consent framing as outbound channels. Never send: stored
  credentials, notification history, or non-router traffic.
- Confidence gate: downshift only on a calibrated high-probability decision; low confidence, a Jev
  error or timeout, or the router being on a native Anthropic request falls through to the user's
  chosen model untouched. A Jev outage must behave exactly as if adaptive routing were off.
- Ledger every adaptive decision (source `heuristic`/`jev`, chosen vs. requested model) as redacted
  rows beside the proxy ledger, and show the routing page which tier a request would get.
- Loopback promise intact by default: no request leaves the machine unless Jev (or a later BYOK
  decision model) is enabled with a key.

## Product and platform tasks

- Local usage: read-only Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Kilo CLI, Muse Code, and Gemini CLI token,
  project, provider, recent-session, and per-request priced summaries are in the WebUI, natively and
  inside WSL. Add a durable/versioned file index with scan progress (a cold scan re-parses every
  ledger after each broker start), fork replay attribution, and historical rate schedules before
  treating the numbers as a spend ledger.
- Live quota: Codex's documented app-server RPC and Claude Code's first-party account-usage
  endpoint feed separately cached windows for the current, secondary (`.codex-*`/`.claude-*`), WSL,
  and up to 16 hand-added profiles. Every account can be renamed, moved, removed, and restored. A
  native macOS client now shows one status item per selected account and lists every account and
  returned window; Live quota configures enabled state, 5–60 minute refresh, and menu-bar accounts.
  OpenCode Go has a per-model published-cap estimate whose monthly window can follow the renewal
  day. Add a stable Claude source or statusline bridge, context-tiered Go rates, and opt-in,
  labelled unofficial sources for tools without a public quota API (Gemini CLI/Antigravity, Cursor,
  Copilot, Kilo; Muse Code only reports quota on a billed request).
- API accounts: encrypted, write-only keys show DeepSeek, Kimi, SiliconFlow, and OpenRouter balance
  or spend and OpenAI/Anthropic Admin cost history from official endpoints. Remaining: spend history
  derived from balance changes for balance-only providers, real-key verification of the OpenAI and
  Anthropic cost reports, and xAI's management-key billing.
- WSL on Windows: running distributions are discovered for Usage, Live quota, and skill installs
  (web interface, Settings, `install-skill --wsl`) and were checked on the owner's Windows machine.
  Remaining: a WSL-aware harness installer.
- Insights dashboard: implemented as a responsive, animated browser composition of live account
  balances, 30-day usage/cost, agent mix, daily trend, top projects, Go estimates, and broker health.
  It preserves quota-versus-local-history provenance and reduced-motion behavior.

- Search, filtering, export, route/delivery audit views, backups, and retention controls.
- Safer terminal/editor activation, Windows Terminal integration, and virtual desktop awareness.
- Signed x64/ARM64 releases, checksums, schema migration recovery, automatic updates, and rollback.
- Accessibility, keyboard navigation, localization, high-contrast support, multi-DPI/multi-monitor verification.
- Native macOS quota menu bar is implemented; extend it into a full notification-center/settings client and add a Linux tray/desktop implementation.
- Documentation/wiki site, examples, architecture decision records, contributor guides, and integration recipes. GitHub Pages is published by the repository workflow.
