# Bug log

Defects found in Nokoo after a capability was considered complete, with what actually caused
them and how each was verified. This is a record for contributors: several of these were only
reachable by running the product rather than by reading it or by unit tests, and the pattern is
worth learning from.

Verification detail for each entry lives in [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md).

## Settings window closed the application when a saved provider was selected

**Found:** 2026-08-12, by the maintainer configuring a real Telegram bot.
**Fixed in:** `fix/settings-json-null-crash`. **Severity:** high — terminated the broker.

### Symptoms

1. **Test send** delivered a message to Telegram successfully, but the Settings window then showed
   an error mentioning null.
2. Clicking the saved **Telegram** provider in the list closed the whole application, every time.

### Cause

`JsonElement.TryGetInt32` does not behave the way its name implies. It returns `false` only when the
element is a number that will not fit in an `Int32`, and **throws `InvalidOperationException` for
every other value kind, including JSON `null`**.

The Settings window read optional integers as:

```csharp
root.TryGetProperty("messageThreadId", out var thread) && thread.TryGetInt32(out var threadId)
```

Optional provider settings are serialized as `null` when the user leaves the field blank, so a
Telegram provider saved without a topic ID stores `"messageThreadId": null` — and reading it back
threw. Any Telegram provider without a topic ID was affected, which is the common case.

The two symptoms were the same exception surfacing in two different places:

- `Provider_Selected` runs **outside** `RunAsync`, so the exception reached the WPF dispatcher
  unhandled and terminated the tray process, taking the broker and its loopback API down with it.
- `TestProvider_Click` runs **inside** `RunAsync`, which catches everything and displays
  `exception.Message`. It saves, sends, then reloads and reselects the provider — so the throw
  happened *after* Telegram had already accepted the message, making a successful send look failed.

The same unsafe pattern existed at **eight** call sites: SMTP port, Telegram topic ID, Pushover
emergency retry and expiry, Twilio SMS validity, Twilio WhatsApp validity, and MQTT port, QoS, and
message expiry. Telegram was simply the first provider configured with a real account.

### Fix

`Nokoo.Core.JsonConfigReader` reads optional values and treats absent, `null`, and
wrong-typed entries alike as "not set". All eight sites use it. `Provider_Selected` additionally
catches anything a stored profile can throw and reports it in the status line, so no saved row can
terminate the process again.

### Lessons

- A `Try`-prefixed API is not automatically total. `JsonElement.TryGetInt32` throws for the input a
  user is most likely to produce. A test now asserts that behaviour so the assumption is pinned.
- `catch (JsonException)` around JSON handling looked defensive but caught the wrong exception type.
- Any handler that can run outside the panel's `RunAsync` wrapper can kill the process. UI event
  handlers need their own guard.

## Settings could get stuck editing a saved provider with no way back to a new one

**Found:** 2026-08-13, by the maintainer adding a second provider.
**Fixed in:** `fix/provider-editor-reset`. **Severity:** medium — the tab became unusable until the
Settings window was closed and reopened.

### Symptoms

After selecting an already-configured provider in **Channels → Providers**, there was no way to add
another one. The provider type dropdown was greyed out with no explanation, nothing deselected the
list row, and the only recovery was closing the Settings window and opening it again — which works
because `App.ShowSettings` drops its window reference on `Closed`, so the panel is rebuilt from
scratch.

### Cause

Three things combined, none of which is a thrown exception:

1. **The escape hatch was easy to miss.** The only way back to a blank editor was a button labelled
   just `New`, sitting under the list beside `Delete`, with no heading and nothing to say which
   profile the right-hand form belonged to.
2. **The escape hatch could be off-screen.** The left column was a `StackPanel` holding a
   fixed `Height="330"` list followed by the buttons, inside a tab that does not scroll. Whenever
   the available height fell below roughly 380px — the window near its `MinHeight="580"`, or a
   higher display scale — the `StackPanel` was clipped and the `New` and `Delete` buttons were
   simply not rendered.
3. **Selecting a profile locked the type dropdown permanently.** `LoadSelectedProvider` sets
   `ProviderKindBox.IsEnabled = false` because a saved profile's kind cannot change. Nothing said
   so, and `Provider_Selected` returned early on a null selection, so clearing the selection left
   the previous profile's values and its disabled dropdown in place.

### Fix

- Both list columns are now `Grid`s whose list row is `*` with a `MinHeight`, so the list shrinks
  and the buttons stay visible at every window size instead of the buttons being pushed out.
- `+ New provider` / `+ New route` are full-width buttons above their list, with `Delete selected`
  below it and a line of help text between them.
- The editor has a heading that reads `New provider` or `Editing "<name>"`, so the form's subject is
  always visible.
- The disabled provider type dropdown now shows why it is disabled and what to press instead.
- Pressing Escape in either list returns to a blank editor.
- `Provider_Selected` and `Route_Selected` reset their form when the selection becomes null, so
  every path that clears a selection — the button, Escape, a delete, a reload — lands on the same
  usable state. The reset runs inside a guard that reports failures in the status line, following
  the lesson from the entry above: a handler outside `RunAsync` must never reach the dispatcher.

### Lessons

- A fixed-height control in a non-scrolling `StackPanel` does not overflow, it disappears — and it
  takes whatever follows it with it. The controls that must never vanish belong in `Auto` rows, with
  the resizable content in the `*` row.
- Disabling a control without saying why leaves a dead end. The recovery has to be visible from the
  state the user is stuck in.

## Local state could be written into the working directory on macOS and Linux

**Found:** 2026-08-12, by running the Linux broker. **Fixed in:** `feature/cross-platform-core`.
**Severity:** high — wrote the local bearer token to an unexpected location.

On Unix, `Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)` returns an **empty string**
when the directory does not exist yet, which is the normal state of a fresh account. Combining that
empty string produced the relative path `Nokoo`, so the first run wrote `config.json` —
containing the local bearer token — plus `secret.key` and the history database into whatever
directory the broker happened to start in. On a developer machine that is the repository being
worked on, where it could be committed.

`ConfigStore.DefaultConfigDir` now resolves through `SpecialFolderOption.Create`, then
`XDG_DATA_HOME`, then `$HOME`, and always returns an absolute path. Covered by a regression test.

## `nokood` ignored SIGTERM

**Found:** 2026-08-12, by stopping the Linux broker. **Fixed in:** `feature/cross-platform-core`.
**Severity:** high — the daemon could not be stopped normally.

The `PosixSignalRegistration` objects were created and discarded. Once finalized, the handler is
unhooked, so the broker neither shut down nor exited on `SIGTERM` and could only be stopped with
`SIGKILL` — unmanageable under systemd or launchd. The registrations are now held for the lifetime
of the process. Shutdown could also hang forever on an unbounded dispatcher stop; every step is now
bounded and a second signal exits immediately.

## Sound file names were sanitized inconsistently across platforms

**Found:** 2026-08-12, by the first Linux and macOS CI run. **Fixed in:**
`fix/portable-filename-sanitizing`. **Severity:** medium.

`Path.GetFileName` is platform-dependent: Windows treats `\` as a separator, Unix treats it as an
ordinary file-name character. A configured sound of `C:\outside\global.MP3` therefore passed through
sanitizing unchanged on Linux and macOS, so the invariant that a configured sound is a bare file
name inside the managed directory did not hold there. Since `config.json` is portable between
machines, `SafeFileName.Last` now normalizes identically on every platform using plain string
operations.

This is the only defect so far found by CI rather than by a person, and it is a good argument for
the Linux and macOS runners.

## A fallback chain stopped at the first target that rejected the request

**Found:** 2026-09-20, by the owner, using a four-target combo to avoid exactly this. **Fixed in:**
`fix/failover-on-upstream-400`. **Severity:** high.

A combo of four targets returned `Upstream returned HTTP 400 (invalid_request_error)` to the agent
with three targets untried. `IsRetryableStatus` listed `401`, `402`, `403`, `404`, `408`, `429` and
the `5xx` family; `400` was deliberately excluded on the reasoning that a `4xx` is the request's
fault and no other target can help.

That reasoning is sound for a client that talks to one provider and wrong for a router. Each target
is sent its **own rendering** of the request — a different wire, its own translation, and its own
rules about identifiers, role order, and which fields it accepts — so one provider refusing what it
was sent predicts nothing about the next refusing what it *will* be sent. The one status most likely
to differ between providers was the one status that ended the chain.

`400` now fails over as `upstream_rejected`, and is the only fail-over status that does not cool the
target down, because it describes the request rather than the provider's health. A translation
failure for one target likewise ends that attempt instead of the request.

The test that had to be rewritten, `Upstream400_NotRetried`, is the point: the suite was pinning the
defect in place, and had been since the behaviour was written. A passing test only proves the code
does what someone once decided it should.

## Replayed reasoning identifiers poisoned every later turn of a conversation

**Found:** 2026-09-20, by the owner, in a Codex session that failed identically after a model change.
**Fixed in:** `fix/responses-item-id-sanitising`. **Severity:** medium.

A stateless Responses client replays its whole history each turn, every item carrying the identifier
the upstream that produced it assigned. A ChatGPT-plan backend issues reasoning identifiers shaped
`rs_<response>:rs_<item>`, and the Responses contract accepts only letters, digits, underscores and
dashes — so once one entered the history, every later turn was rejected with `400` naming the index,
and kept being rejected after a model change because the history travelled with it.

The router minted none of this and joined nothing with a colon; a same-wire hop rewrote only `model`
and forwarded `input` verbatim. That is the defect: routing is what lets turn N and turn N+1 land on
different providers, so the router owns the consequence of conversation state being provider-scoped.
Such identifiers are now stripped, and a reasoning item carrying one is dropped, with the count
logged rather than applied silently.

The failing request body was not recoverable — provider error bodies are deliberately never stored —
so this was diagnosed from the upstream's own error text. That privacy guarantee has a diagnostic
cost, and this is the first time it was paid.

## Recurring theme

Every entry above was found by **running the software**, not by reading it, and not by the unit
tests — which numbered in the hundreds, then the thousands, and passed throughout. In one case a
test actively held the defect in place. Cross-compilation proved the code
built for five runtimes while three of these defects sat in it. A test suite and a green build say
nothing about whether the first run on a fresh account puts your bearer token in the right place.
