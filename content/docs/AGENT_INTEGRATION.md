# Agent integration guide

Prefer the installed `agentnotify.exe` CLI. It discovers the local port/token, produces correct JSON, handles errors, and keeps the broker as the lifecycle source of truth.

## Automatic harnesses (preferred)

The skill below relies on the model remembering to call AgentNotify. The
harness removes the remembering: OpenCode, Codex, and Claude Code can notify
automatically at permission prompts, questions, session completion, and
session errors through their own hooks/plugin system:

```bash
agentnotify install-harness opencode
agentnotify install-harness codex
agentnotify install-harness claude
```

Harnesses are notify-only — they never approve, deny, or block. Install both
the harness and the skill. See [HARNESS.md](HARNESS.md).

## Install the agent skill

Install the skill embedded in the CLI:

```bash
agentnotify install-skill codex
agentnotify install-skill claude
```

For a repository-local installation:

```bash
agentnotify install-skill codex --scope project
```

The tray's Copy/Download actions remain available. The canonical source is
`distribution/agentnotify/SKILL.md`; see [AGENT_SKILLS.md](AGENT_SKILLS.md) for paths, overwrite
protection, WSL behavior, and manual installation.

## Availability check

An agent may check once near task start:

```bash
agentnotify.exe health
```

If AgentNotify is unavailable, continue useful work and report the notification failure only when relevant. Do not loop or block the user’s task trying to restore the broker.

## Attention request

```bash
agentnotify.exe send \
  --agent codex \
  --agent-instance codex-71dc \
  --project payments \
  --type input_required \
  --priority high \
  --key codex-71dc-schema-decision \
  --title "Need schema decision" \
  --message "Choose normalized or denormalized storage."
```

Capture the returned `id`. When the condition is answered or otherwise clears:

```bash
agentnotify.exe resolve NOTIFICATION_ID
```

## Completion, blocker, and permission examples

```bash
agentnotify.exe send --agent codex --project payments \
  --type completed --title "Task complete" --message "Implementation is complete and the test suite passes."



agentnotify.exe send --agent codex --project payments \
  --type permission_required --priority high --key payments-production-approval \
  --title "Approval required" --message "May I deploy this build to production?"
```

Use notifications at attention boundaries, not as a transcript. Routine progress, tool calls, and ordinary substeps should not generate toasts.

## Type selection

- `input_required`: user answer/decision blocks useful work.
- `permission_required`: explicit authorization is required.
- `blocked`: prerequisite/external condition prevents progress.
- `error`: significant failed operation needs attention.
- `completed`: requested work finished.
- `success`: important intermediate operation succeeded.
- `warning`: attention is advisable but progress can continue.
- `info`: meaningful non-actionable milestone; use sparingly.

Sticky attention types are shown until dismissed/resolved. Timed types transition to dismissed when their toast expires and appear under Recent.

## Deduplication

Use a stable key per logical unresolved condition:

```bash
agentnotify.exe send --key build-main --type error --title "Build failed" --message "12 errors"
agentnotify.exe send --key build-main --type warning --title "Build improving" --message "2 errors remain"
```

The second request updates the active notification. Once dismissed/resolved, reusing the key creates a new lifecycle.

## WSL

The Windows installer adds `agentnotify.exe` to the Windows user `PATH`. Open a new WSL shell after installation so WSL imports that change, then call the executable directly:

```bash
agentnotify.exe send --type info --title "From WSL" --message "The agent can reach Windows."
```

For repository development:

```bash
./scripts/package.sh
./scripts/install-wsl-wrapper.sh
agentnotify health
```

The wrapper first uses `agentnotify.exe` from PATH, then the local packaged payload. It does not read or print the token.

## Direct HTTP fallback

Use direct HTTP only when the CLI cannot be used. Obtain the token without echoing it into logs, send it as `Authorization: Bearer`, and follow `docs/API.md`. Never include the token in prompts, issue reports, notification metadata, or remote requests.

Agents can post ARC attention-request events to `/v1/events`. See [ARC.md](ARC.md). Provider-stream,
ACP, and A2A translation are future adapters, not current claims. The researched bidirectional
response design, including the distinction between Agent Client Protocol and Agent Communication
Protocol/A2A, is in
[BIDIRECTIONAL_AGENT_COMMUNICATION.md](BIDIRECTIONAL_AGENT_COMMUNICATION.md).

## Prompt snippet

```text
Use AgentNotify at meaningful attention boundaries. Notify before waiting for required input or permission, after exhausting safe alternatives when blocked, and on completion of long-running work. Use a stable key for one unresolved condition, capture the returned ID, and resolve it when the condition clears. Do not notify for routine progress.
```
