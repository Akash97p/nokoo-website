# Releases and GitHub Pages

The repository is published at [github.com/Akash97p/agent-notify](https://github.com/Akash97p/agent-notify). These files document the release process; GitHub Actions performs the hosted build and publication after an authorized tag push.

## GitHub repository setup

1. Keep `main` as the stable release line and `dev` as the integration line.
2. Make `main` the default protected branch and require the CI workflow before merge.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the publishing source.
4. Keep normal development on topic branches merged into `dev`; promote a tested release from `dev` to `main` through review.
5. Obtain and configure Authenticode signing before presenting a public build as trusted. The current workflow produces unsigned binaries.

The Pages workflow builds the Next.js application in `site/` as a static export after changes reach
`dev` or `main`. The site uses TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and checked-in shadcn/ui source components;
`scripts/build-site.sh` copies the ARC 0.1 and 0.2 schemas and branding assets, runs `npm ci`, type-checks, builds,
and stages the export in `_site`. GitHub Actions then uploads that directory using the official Pages
actions and requests only read, Pages, and OIDC permissions.

The latest tagged prerelease is
[`v0.2.0-alpha.3`](https://github.com/Akash97p/agent-notify/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha.3),
tagged 2026-09-19; the tag's release workflow publishes the Windows installer, portable archives,
checksums, and skill.
GitHub Pages follows the `dev`/`main` documentation source, so it can describe newer development
features before another binary release is tagged. A user needs a new broker build to try those
features.

## First hosted prerelease: `v0.0.1-alpha.1`

The first hosted prerelease was prepared on the `dev` integration line and published on 2026-08-12:

- Tag: [`v0.0.1-alpha.1`](https://github.com/Akash97p/agent-notify/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha.1)
- Merge commit: `8186aed` (`merge: prepare v0.0.1-alpha.1 prerelease`)
- Actions run: [31566620009](https://github.com/Akash97p/agent-notify/actions/runs/31566620009)
- Result: successful Windows build, test, packaging, and prerelease publication
- Assets: `AgentNotifySetup.exe`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and `SKILL.md`
- Local installer checksum recorded in [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](VERIFICATION.md): `2000b536dc8eac4b72821d0ac6df7b79cb258f4ce7b2f0bfb7456a4df3d7e78b`

This is an alpha evaluation release, not the mature `v1.0.0` release. It may contain incomplete features, breaking changes, unsigned binaries, and unverified provider integrations.

### Version progression

Use the committed `Version` value and exact `v`-prefixed tag together:

| Stage | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-alpha | `v0.0.1-pre-alpha.1` | Internal or very early evaluation |
| Alpha | `v0.0.1-alpha.1` | Active development; unstable and incomplete |
| Beta | `v0.0.1-beta.1` | Feature-complete target with ongoing stabilization |
| Release candidate | `v0.0.1-rc.1` | Candidate for a stable release |
| First mature release | `v1.0.0` | Stable public milestone after release criteria pass |

Any tag containing a hyphen is created by the workflow as a GitHub prerelease. A mature `v1.0.0` release should be promoted from a tested `dev` merge to `main` and should also complete signing, human verification, and release review.

## Release notes

The release description is written by hand in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), not generated from
commit subjects. `scripts/release-notes.sh <tag> [previous-tag]` extracts that version's section and
appends the install instructions, checksum guidance, documentation links, and a compare range. The
workflow runs it and passes the result to `gh release create --notes-file`.

The script **fails when `CHANGELOG.md` has no section for the tagged version**, which stops a
release going out with an empty or wrong description. Add the section before tagging, and preview it
locally:

```bash
./scripts/release-notes.sh v0.0.3-alpha.1 v0.0.2-alpha.1
```

## Create a release

1. Update `Version`, `InformationalVersion`, `AssemblyVersion`, and `FileVersion` in `Directory.Build.props`. Keep the informational value and tag suffix identical; keep the assembly/file values numeric.
2. Add the version's section to `CHANGELOG.md`, then update the verification record and any migration documentation.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ./scripts/package.sh
   ```

4. Verify the installer and `artifacts/SHA256SUMS.txt` on Windows.
5. After the release commit is on the intended release branch, create and push an exact matching tag. Prerelease tags use SemVer-style suffixes and are marked as prereleases automatically:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.0.1-alpha.1 -m "AgentNotify v0.0.1-alpha.1"
   git push origin v0.0.1-alpha.1
   ```

   The tag must exactly equal `v` plus the committed `Version` value. Examples include `v0.0.1-pre-alpha.1`, `v0.0.1-alpha.1`, `v0.0.1-beta.1`, `v0.0.1-rc.1`, and finally `v1.0.0`. The release workflow passes `--prerelease` whenever the tag contains a hyphen.

The tag workflow independently restores, builds, tests, packages, checks the tag against `Directory.Build.props`, and creates a GitHub Release containing:

- `AgentNotifySetup.exe`, the Windows installer;
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`, covering the installer;
- the distributable `SKILL.md`;
- `agentnotify-win-x64.zip` and `agentnotify-{linux,osx}-{x64,arm64}.tar.gz`, the portable CLI and
  `agentnotifyd` broker archives; macOS archives also contain `agentnotify-menubar`; and
- `SHA256SUMS-portable.txt`, covering those archives.

The portable archives are produced by a second job on a macOS runner after the Windows job succeeds.
The .NET binaries still target every RID, but macOS packaging must run there because it compiles the
Swift/AppKit status item separately for x86_64 and arm64.
The two checksum files are deliberately named differently: two assets sharing one name would replace
each other rather than sit side by side.

The workflow fails rather than publishing when tests fail, packaging fails, the version is not SemVer-style, or the tag does not exactly match the product version. Numeric assembly/file metadata is `0.2.0.0` for the current `0.2.0-alpha.3` prerelease because Windows version-resource fields are numeric; API, CLI, installer, registry, package, and release display metadata use `0.2.0-alpha.3`.

## Local packaging

PowerShell is the portable packaging implementation:

```powershell
./scripts/package.ps1
```

The WSL `scripts/package.sh` wrapper resolves the configured Windows SDK path and invokes the same script, preventing local and hosted release logic from drifting.
